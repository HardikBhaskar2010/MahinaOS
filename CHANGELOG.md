## Unreleased

- Started Phase 2 graphics bring-up with `lgp-compositor` DRM/KMS setup, LGP socket lifecycle, 6-byte TLV framing per DL-053, and `LGP_HELLO` handling.
- Fixed compositor client lifecycle so handshaken clients remain tracked until disconnect.
- Added bounded LGP stream reassembly so split socket reads are buffered and parsed as complete TLV frames.
- Added the Phase 2 minimum LGP surface path: `LGP_CREATE_SURFACE`, `LGP_DESTROY_SURFACE`, `LGP_COMMIT_BUFFER`, compositor-owned surface state, `SCM_RIGHTS` shared-memory commits, and a direct-LGP test client.
- Added LGP protocol/surface unit tests and TLV fuzz coverage.
- Documented Mahina setup as GUI-first with terminal setup reserved for emergency and development use.
- Fixed TOML array validation, dependency graph cycle validation, and the clean-tree unit/fuzz test targets.
- Implemented surface Z-order and ARGB8888 software alpha blending in `lgp-compositor`.
- Defined input protocol events (`LGP_MSG_POINTER_MOTION`, etc.) in `tlv.h`.
- Created Phase 3 `LunaGUI` Toolkit (application loop, LGP IPC, window surface wrappers, canvas primitives, widget hierarchy, PSF font rendering).
- Scaffoled Phase 4 `luna-desktop` (shell dock and wallpaper).
- Scaffolded core GUI applications: `luna-installer`, `luna-terminal`, `luna-settings`, `luna-files`.
- Resolved `luna-init` supervisor TODOs regarding HTTP readiness networking constraints.
