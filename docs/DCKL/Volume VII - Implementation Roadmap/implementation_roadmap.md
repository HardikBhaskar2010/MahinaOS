# LunaOS — Implementation Roadmap
**Volume VII · The Build Checklist**
**Classification:** Living Document — Updated as items are completed
**Status:** Active · This is the daily work order

---

## Purpose

This document answers one question: **what gets built first?**

It is a sequential checklist. Each item has a clear definition of "done." Nothing in a later section begins until the items before it are checked off. This is the daily engineering reference for the next year.

Read this document before writing a single line of code.
Update it the moment a milestone is complete.
Never skip an item because it seems small — small items are load-bearing.

- [ ] Boot sequence works: UEFI → limine → kernel → initramfs → real root → luna-init shell

**Done when:** Full boot chain works in QEMU. Stage 0 complete.

---

## STAGE 1 — System Foundation

> **Exit criterion:** The system has networking, a package manager, and can install software without graphical output.

### 1.1 — luna-init: Stage 4 Services

- [ ] Service definition format specified: TOML in `/etc/luna/services/` (DL-008)
- [ ] Service TOML schema implemented: `name`, `binary`, `args`, `slice`, `restart`

- [ ] Service: `NetworkManager` — starts, connects to D-Bus, manages `eth0` in QEMU
- [ ] Service: `ntpd` or `chrony` — starts, syncs clock (DL-015)
- [ ] Service: `PipeWire` — starts (audio, not needed for Stage 1 but service file present)
- [ ] DHCP works: QEMU guest gets an IP address from QEMU's NAT network
- [ ] `ping 8.8.8.8` works from the root shell

**Done when:** Network is up. `curl https://example.com` works from the root shell.

---

### 1.2 — Logging Infrastructure

- [ ] Boot log: `/var/log/luna-init/boot.log` — written by luna-init during boot (already done in 0.6)
- [ ] Runtime log: `/var/log/luna-init/runtime.log` — opened by luna-init after Stage 4, services write here
- [ ] Log rotation: maximum file size defined (e.g., 10 MB), rotation creates `.1`, `.2` suffixes
- [ ] Log severity levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL — all implemented in luna-init's log API
- [ ] Service log API: a C header (`luna_log.h`) that services can include to write to the runtime log
- [ ] No syslog. No journald. File-based only. (`Volume II / 11_logging.md`)

**Done when:** Boot log and runtime log exist after every boot. Rotation triggers at 10 MB.

---

### 1.3 — IPC (D-Bus)

- [ ] D-Bus system bus is running (service started in 1.1)
- [ ] D-Bus session bus is running for user sessions
- [ ] Test: `dbus-send` from root shell succeeds
- [ ] IPC patterns documented in `Volume II / 08_ipc.md` are verified against actual D-Bus behavior

---

### 1.4 — lpkg: Package Manager (Phase 1 — Terminal Only)

- [ ] `lpkg` repository/subdirectory: `src/lpkg/`

- [ ] Package metadata schema: `name`, `version`, `arch`, `deps`, `files[]`, `sha256`
- [ ] `lpkg install <file.lpkg>` — installs to `/usr/` (system) or `~/.local/` (user, DL-017)
- [ ] `lpkg remove <name>` — removes installed package files
- [ ] `lpkg list` — lists installed packages from the package database
- [ ] Package database: SQLite at `/var/lib/lpkg/installed.db` (system) or `~/.local/share/lpkg/installed.db` (user)
- [ ] SHA256 integrity check on every install
- [ ] `lpkg install` is atomic: either all files are installed or none (DL-018)
- [ ] No network downloads yet — installs from local `.lpkg` files only

**Done when:** `lpkg install hello-1.0.lpkg` installs a test package. `lpkg remove hello` uninstalls it cleanly. Database reflects both operations.

---

### 1.5 — lpkg: Package Repository (First-Party)

- [ ] Repository format decided: an index file (TOML) + individual `.lpkg` files over HTTPS
- [ ] Test repository hosted (GitHub Releases or a static file server)
- [ ] `lpkg update` — fetches the repository index
- [ ] `lpkg install <name>` — resolves package from index, downloads, verifies SHA256, installs
- [ ] Dependency resolution: if package A depends on B, install B first
- [ ] Signature verification: GPG or ed25519 (DL-019) — sign all first-party packages
- [ ] `lpkg upgrade` — upgrades all installed packages to latest version
- [ ] Pre-update snapshot (DL-011) — Btrfs snapshot before major upgrades (if filesystem permits)

**Done when:** `lpkg install ncurses` downloads and installs ncurses from the first-party repository.

---

## STAGE 2 — Graphics Primitive

> **Exit criterion:** A rectangle appears on screen, drawn by the LGP compositor. No widgets. No shell. Just: a pixel on screen from a compositor-owned surface.

### 2.1 — DRM/KMS Device Setup

- [ ] Backend 2: OpenGL/EGL via GBM — skeleton only in Stage 2, full in Stage 3
- [ ] lgp-render backend is selected at startup based on hardware capability
- [ ] Test: lgp-render draws a colored rectangle to a GBM framebuffer and presents via KMS

**Done when:** lgp-render's software backend produces a rectangle on screen via KMS.

- [ ] Message: `LGP_DESTROY_SURFACE` — free the surface entry
- [ ] Message: `LGP_COMMIT_BUFFER` — accept shm buffer via `SCM_RIGHTS`, map it
- [ ] Compositor frame loop: composite all committed surfaces → present via KMS
- [ ] Compositor signals readiness: write sentinel or D-Bus signal
- [ ] luna-init Stage 5: starts lgp-compositor, waits for readiness signal

**Done when:** A test client connects, creates a surface, commits an shm buffer, and the compositor displays it on screen.

---

### 2.4 — Boot Splash (Framebuffer)

- [ ] Boot splash renderer in luna-init (before compositor starts)
- [ ] Splash: LUNA Void background + LunaOS wordmark (bitmap, no font rendering needed)
- [ ] Splash displays from Stage 3 until compositor starts in Stage 5
- [ ] Transition: compositor claims framebuffer, splash disappears
- [ ] Boot splash respects Animation Budget: transition ≤ 300ms

**Done when:** Boot shows the splash. Compositor start replaces it cleanly.

---

### 2.5 — Input: libinput

- [ ] libinput linked into the compositor
- [ ] libinput seat opened: `/dev/input/` event devices
- [ ] Keyboard events read from libinput and logged (terminal debug output)

- [ ] Contains: LUNA presence indicator (a color dot — LUNA Green = active, LUNA Void = idle)
- [ ] luna-island receives mode changes from luna-ai-d via D-Bus
- [ ] Mode change animates: `Fade` out current state, `Fade` in new state
- [ ] luna-island is always visible — never minimized, never covered (Z-order enforces)

- [ ] Background colors available via compositor context
- [ ] LunaGUI `LunaTheme.current()` returns hardcoded Luna Dark values
- [ ] Typography scale hardcoded: size_md = 15px, Inter (or fallback)

**Done when:** The entire desktop uses the Luna Dark color palette consistently. No hex values are hardcoded in application code — all via semantic tokens.

---

## STAGE 4 — Full Presence

> **Exit criterion:** LUNA can converse, remember, and reason. Package management is complete. The system is self-updating and self-describing.

### 4.1 — luna-ai-d: LLM Inference Engine

- [ ] Test: switch from Luna Dark to a community theme — entire desktop updates without restart

**Done when:** Theme switching works live. No application restart required.

---

### 4.4 — lpkg: Graphical Permission Interface

- [ ] lpkg daemon sends permission request via D-Bus to luna-ai-d
- [ ] luna-ai-d triggers LUNA permission dialog (a `LAYER_SYSTEM_MODAL` compositor surface)
- [ ] Permission dialog: package name, what it installs, trust level — user clicks Allow/Deny
- [ ] Deny: install aborted cleanly
- [ ] Allow: install proceeds
- [ ] Dialog uses LUNA Amber (#FFB800) for warning-level install, LUNA Pink for critical-level

**Done when:** `lpkg install <package>` triggers the graphical permission dialog.

---

### 4.5 — DMA-BUF Support (CANVAS_SURFACE with GPU)

- [ ] Third-party apps run with no capabilities by default
- [ ] Filesystem access: restricted to app-specific directories + XDG portals for user files
- [ ] Network access: must be declared in package manifest and confirmed by user at install

**Done when:** A third-party application cannot read files outside its declared scope.

---

### 5.4 — ABI/API Stability

- [ ] LGP protocol version field added to all messages (BLOCKER 5)
- [ ] LGP version negotiation: client sends `LGP_HELLO {version: 1}`, compositor confirms
- [ ] LunaGUI C API: all public symbols exported via `LUNAGUI_API` macro
- [ ] API stability guarantee: no symbol removed or signature changed within a minor version
- [ ] Changelog maintained: every API addition/removal documented
