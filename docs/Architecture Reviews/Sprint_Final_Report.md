# LunaOS Documentation Maintenance Sprint — Final Report
**Date:** 2026-06-27
**Sprint Goal:** Stage 0 Readiness — Resolve architectural drift and sync documentation with accepted decisions before implementation begins.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The documentation maintenance sprint is complete. The repository has been audited against the Principal Engineer Review (AR-004). 
All accepted decisions have been propagated to their respective subsystem specifications. Outdated assumptions (e.g., Wayland, ext4) have been purged. The repository is now structurally sound for Stage 1 implementation.

Volume VI (Development Bible) has been bootstrapped, providing the missing engineering standards and AI coding rules required to maintain consistency as the codebase scales.

## 2. Work Completed

### Phase 1: Critical Cleanup
- **Purged Wayland/Hyprland references** from all Foundation documents. LunaOS uses the custom LGP compositor exclusively.
- **Fixed DL numbering collision** in `10_decision_status_standard.md` (syncing with `decision_log.md`).

### Phase 2: Decision Propagation (AR-004)
- **Boot Flow (`02_boot_flow.md`)**: Updated to reflect Btrfs root (DL-027) and the single black-frame compositor handoff (DL-043).
- **LGP & Graphics (`01_lgp.md`, `02_rendering_pipeline.md`, `03_compositor.md`)**: Documented TLV wire format (DL-025), libinput backend (DL-032), D-Bus compositor readiness signal (DL-031), and Vulkan/Software backend stages (DL-026).
- **Component Ownership (`13_component_ownership.md`)**: Resolved missing ownership for the Screen Lock (`luna-lock`, DL-035), Conversation Panel (`luna-island`, DL-044), Clipboard (LGP extension, DL-033), and Accessibility (AT-SPI2, DL-040).
- **Implementation Roadmap (`implementation_roadmap.md`)**: Cleaned up stale "provisional" tags and marked all Stage 2 blocking decisions as resolved.

### Phase 3: Terminology & Consistency
- **Canonical Naming Enforced**: Standardized references to `luna-shell`, `luna-island`, `luna-init`, `lpkg`, `lgp-compositor`, and `luna-ai-d` across all volumes.
- **Duplicate Checklists**: Cleaned up the `Progress.md` tracking document.

### Phase 4: Volume VI — Development Bible
Created the foundational engineering standards:
- `01_coding_standards.md`: C17 systems programming rules, zero-allocation hot paths, strict error handling.
- `02_ai_coding_guidelines.md`: Rules for AI coding agents to prevent architectural drift.
- `03_architecture_rules.md`: Strict isolation, IPC selection, and ownership rules.
- `04_benchmarks.md`: Quantitative targets for boot time, 60fps render latency, and AI inference latency.
- `08_contributing.md`: The contribution process emphasizing the Decision Log over pull requests for architecture.

## 3. Pending Decisions (Blocking Later Stages)

While Stage 1 and Stage 2 are fully unblocked, the following decisions remain unresolved and will block Stage 4/5 implementation. A new Architecture Review session should be scheduled to address these.

### 1. AI Model Selection & Distribution (Volume IV)
- **Default LLM:** DL-006 is deprecated. A firm decision is needed on the v1 default model (e.g., Phi-3 Mini 3.8B Q4).
- **First-Boot Download:** If the default model is not bundled in the `.iso`, the installer (`06_installer.md`) must handle downloading it, which requires network access during installation.
- **Vision Models:** `08_vision.md` has no corresponding DL entry specifying if vision capability is v1, v2, or optional.

### 2. Package Manager Security (Volume V)
- **Signing Algorithm:** The `lpkg` package signing mechanism (GPG vs ed25519) needs a firm DL entry.
- **Hash Verification Source:** If models are downloaded via Ollama, LunaOS needs a secure way to verify the model hash to prevent tampering.

### 3. Installer Workflow (Volume V)
- `06_installer.md` needs to be updated to integrate the Btrfs partition setup (DL-027) and the `observe.toml` privacy configuration step (DL-022) into the user flow.

### 4. AI Runtime Language
- `00_luna_runtime.md` specifies C for `luna-ai-d` v1, but Python may be more appropriate for initial development (similar to `lpkg`). This requires a firm DL entry.

### 5. Visual Language (Volume III)
- **Icon Set:** Still marked as "Pending DL entry". (Recommendation: Phosphor Icons).
- **Companion Reading Font:** Still marked as "Pending DL entry".

**Sign-off:** *Luna Kitsune (AI Agent)* — Sprint Complete.
