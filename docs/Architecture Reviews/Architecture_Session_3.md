# Architecture Review Session 3

## Project: LunaOS

## Topic: Luna Performance Lab & System Performance Philosophy

---

# Meeting Objective

This architecture review exists to define the philosophy, architecture, and implementation direction of LunaOS's advanced system tuning environment.

Unlike conventional operating systems that expose only a handful of power profiles, LunaOS aims to provide complete visibility and control over every major subsystem while maintaining safe defaults.

The purpose of this meeting is **not** to discuss overclocking.

The purpose is to define what "User Control" truly means inside LunaOS.

---

# Background

One of LunaOS's Core Laws states:

> **Control Over Possession**

The operating system exists to empower users rather than restrict them.

Most operating systems intentionally hide advanced controls.

LunaOS should instead expose them responsibly.

The operating system should never assume the user is incapable of understanding their machine.

Instead, it should educate, explain, and allow informed decisions.

---

# Problem Statement

Current operating systems generally provide only simplified power modes such as:

* Power Saver
* Balanced
* Performance

These profiles hide thousands of scheduler, memory, graphics, storage, networking, and power-management decisions from the user.

Advanced users must instead modify kernel parameters, edit configuration files, install third-party tools, or access firmware settings.

This contradicts LunaOS's philosophy.

---

# Goals

The Luna Performance Lab should become the central engineering console of the operating system.

Rather than exposing only CPU performance, it should expose every configurable subsystem that affects system behavior.

Potential categories include:

* CPU
* GPU
* Scheduler
* Memory
* Storage
* Filesystem
* Networking
* AI Runtime
* Animation System
* Graphics Pipeline
* Power Management
* Battery
* Cooling
* Process Priorities
* Background Services
* Security Performance Trade-offs

---

# Design Philosophy

The Performance Lab is not a benchmark application.

It is not an overclocking utility.

It is an engineering interface.

The objective is transparency.

Every configurable parameter should explain:

* What it controls.
* Why it exists.
* Performance impact.
* Battery impact.
* Stability impact.
* Security impact.
* Recommended users.

Users should understand the consequences of every decision.

---

# Performance Profiles

Traditional operating systems provide generic profiles.

LunaOS may instead provide contextual profiles.

Examples include:

🌿 Calm

Optimized for battery life, quiet operation, and minimal distractions.

---

⚡ Focus

Optimized for programming, compiling, multitasking, and productivity.

---

🎮 Gaming

Prioritizes graphics, latency, and input responsiveness.

---

🎥 Creative

Optimized for rendering, editing, AI inference, and media workloads.

---

🚀 Unleashed

Aggressive system tuning while remaining within hardware-supported operating limits.

---

☢ Experimental

Unlocks advanced engineering controls.

Requires explicit acknowledgement before activation.

---

# Experimental Mode

Experimental Mode represents the highest level of user freedom.

This mode does **not** intentionally bypass hardware or firmware protections.

Instead, it exposes advanced capabilities already supported by the underlying platform whenever available.

Possible examples include:

* CPU governor selection
* Scheduler tuning
* I/O scheduler configuration
* ZRAM configuration
* Huge Pages
* Memory compression
* Process scheduling priorities
* Graphics scheduling
* AI resource allocation
* Animation frame budgets
* Storage optimization
* NUMA behavior
* Hardware-specific firmware features

Capabilities vary depending on hardware support.

---

# Safety Philosophy

Safety remains enabled by default.

Advanced controls remain hidden until explicitly enabled.

Before entering Experimental Mode, LunaOS should clearly explain:

* Potential stability risks.
* Increased power consumption.
* Increased temperatures.
* Reduced hardware lifespan.
* Possible warranty implications.
* Hardware dependency.

The user must explicitly acknowledge these risks.

Example confirmation:

"I understand the potential consequences of enabling Experimental Mode."

---

# Relationship to Firmware

LunaOS should not replace firmware configuration.

Instead, it should integrate with supported firmware capabilities whenever safe and technically feasible.

If a motherboard exposes configurable hardware features, LunaOS may provide an interface for them while clearly identifying that they originate from firmware rather than the operating system itself.

---

# AI Integration

LUNA should assist users without making decisions on their behalf.

Examples:

* Explain each setting.
* Recommend profiles based on workload.
* Predict thermal impact.
* Estimate battery impact.
* Suggest safer alternatives.
* Detect conflicting settings.

LUNA may advise.

The user decides.

---

# Open Research Questions

The following questions remain unresolved.

1. Should Performance Lab become a standalone application or part of Settings?

2. Should every configurable kernel parameter be exposed?

3. Should profile presets be community shareable?

4. Should users be able to create custom performance profiles?

5. Should AI automatically recommend profile changes?

6. Should certain hardware controls remain firmware-only?

7. Should enterprise deployments disable Experimental Mode?

8. How should rollback work after unstable configurations?

---

# Possible Future Documents

The outcome of this meeting may create additional documentation including:

* performance_lab.md
* performance_profiles.md
* experimental_mode.md
* hardware_management.md
* kernel_tuning.md
* ai_performance_assistant.md

---

# Expected Deliverables

This session should ultimately produce:

* One Architecture Decision Record.
* One Non-Negotiable update if required.
* One dedicated subsystem specification.
* Multiple implementation documents within Volume V.

---

# Session Status

Status: Open

Decision Confidence: Research Phase

Implementation Status: Not Started

Target Volume: Volume V — Userland

Priority: High

Notes:

The Luna Performance Lab has the potential to become one of LunaOS's defining features by transforming system tuning from a hidden engineering task into a transparent, educational, and user-controlled experience.
