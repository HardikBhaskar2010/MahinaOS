## The Three Laws of LunaOS

These are not guidelines. These are laws. Every technical decision, every design choice, every feature inclusion or exclusion traces back to one or more of these three laws. If a feature violates a law, it does not ship.

---

### Law I — Own Every Layer

> *No borrowed base. No mystery components. No blind trust.*

Every component in LunaOS is either:
- Written from scratch by the LunaOS project, OR
- Explicitly chosen, deeply understood, and tracked in the project's git history

This is what separates LunaOS from a rice. When someone asks "what is that process?" — you have an answer, because you put it there.

**What this means in practice:**
- We do not base on Arch, Debian, or any upstream distro
- We track our own kernel `.config` in git — it represents deliberate decisions
- We write `luna-init` rather than adopt systemd, OpenRC, or s6
- We write `lpkg` rather than adopt pacman or apt
- When we use upstream tools (Ollama, PipeWire), we know exactly what they do and why we chose them

**What this does NOT mean:**
- We don't rewrite the kernel
- We don't rewrite glibc
- LGP is a ground-up protocol tailored specifically for LunaOS.
- Ownership is about understanding and intentionality, not reinventing everything

### Law II — Local First, Cloud When Useful

> *The machine you own should work without anyone else's permission.*

LunaOS must function completely offline. AI must work offline. Search must work offline. Package management can be offline if the local cache exists. Every core feature works on a flight at 35,000 feet with no Wi-Fi.

Cloud features are enhancements. Never dependencies.

**The cloud bridge (OpenRouter API) is:**
- Opt-in, never opt-out
- Never triggered automatically without explicit user instruction
- Clearly indicated in the UI when it's being used (LUNA glows differently when talking to the cloud)
- Fully skippable — a LunaOS without cloud access is still a complete LunaOS

**The privacy corollary:**
All user data — patterns, memory, observations, preferences — lives in `~/.luna/`. The user controls every byte. `luna memory --clear` is always available and always works.

---

### Law III — Aesthetic Is Functional

> *Beauty is not decoration. It is information density.*

Every animation in LunaOS exists because it communicates something. Every color choice encodes meaning. The NEON/DARK visual language is not a theme applied on top — it is the interface vocabulary.

| If it's purely decorative | If it communicates state |
|---|---|
| Don't ship it | Ship it |

**Examples of this law in practice:**
- Glitch flicker = error state. Not "looks cool" — means something broke.
- Slow pulse = LUNA.AI is watching passively in the background
- Fast pulse = LUNA.AI is actively processing right now
- Particle burst = task completed successfully
- Data stream scroll = model is generating output
- Scanline sweep = application is initializing

When users learn this vocabulary, they stop reading the status bar. They feel the system state. That's the goal.

## Five Core Principles

Beyond the three laws, these principles guide daily decisions:

### 1. Control Over Possession

The OS must never own the user. Automation is optional. Permissions are explicit. The user can turn off any LUNA.AI observation module with a single command. The user can wipe all AI memory with a single command. The user can disable LUNA entirely and run a minimal, clean Linux desktop.

LunaOS gives you tools. It does not obligate you to use them.

### 2. Silence Is a Feature

LUNA.AI should err toward silence. A suggestion that fires too early poisons the well — users dismiss it once, then dismiss it forever, then disable the feature. Better to wait until confidence is high and surface the right thing once, than to guess constantly.

Default behavior: observe quietly. Speak rarely. Be right.

### 3. Complexity Under, Simplicity Over

The boot process is complex. The init system is complex. The package manager dependency graph is complex. The user sees none of this. They see: machine turns on, desktop appears, OS works.

Complexity belongs below the surface. The surface must be clean.

### 4. Continuous Improvement, Never Disruption

When another OS solves a problem elegantly, LunaOS studies it. Not to copy it, but to understand *why* it works and then find a more intentional solution. LunaOS is not above learning from macOS's window management or Windows' driver model. It's above copying them blindly.

Updates to LunaOS should never surprise the user. New features add capability. Nothing regresses. Nothing changes without the user understanding why.

### 5. Motion Creates Presence

A static desktop is a tool. A desktop with thoughtful motion is an environment. The difference between using a machine and *inhabiting* one.

Every animation is budgeted: it must complete in under 200ms for UI interactions, under 400ms for transitions, under 1s for complex state changes. Longer than that and motion becomes latency.

## What LunaOS Is Not

Some things this document explicitly rejects:

**Not a productivity suite.** LunaOS does not ship office software, project management tools, or cloud-synced note-taking. Those are user choices.

**Not a gaming OS.** Gaming support is welcome but not a first-class concern. If PREEMPT_RT helps audio latency and happens to help gaming too, great. We don't optimize kernel config around frame times.

**Not an AI chatbot wrapper.** LUNA.AI is a workflow intelligence layer, not a chat interface bolted onto Linux. The distinction matters enormously.

**Not a locked-down appliance.** The user can break LunaOS in any direction they choose. We make it easy to stay on the happy path. We don't block the exits.

**Not finished.** This is a living operating system. v1.0 is not done — it's the first full expression of the vision. v2.0 exists, v3.0 exists, they just haven't been written yet.

---

## The Honest Statement

Building an OS from scratch is hard. Building one that's also beautiful, intelligent, and usable is harder. This project will take years, not months.

The philosophy exists precisely because that's true. Without it, the project drifts. Without the three laws, "ship fast" beats "ship right" and LunaOS becomes just another distro with a pretty theme.

The philosophy is the backbone. Every other decision hangs from it.
